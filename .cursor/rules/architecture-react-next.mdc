# Architecture Rules (React + Next.js)

## General Principles
- Prefer readability over abstraction.
- Avoid clever or non-obvious patterns.
- One file should have one clear responsibility.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase.

## Layers
- UI (React components): rendering only, no business logic.
- Application (hooks/services): orchestration and use cases.
- Domain: pure business logic, framework-agnostic.
- Infrastructure: API clients, storage, external services.

## Dependency Direction
- UI → Application → Domain.
- Domain must not depend on React, Next.js, or browser APIs.

## Pages
- `page.tsx` files must stay thin.
- No business logic in pages.
- Pages orchestrate components and hooks only.
