# React Component Rules

- Components should be dumb by default.
- Prefer props over internal logic.
- Business logic must live in hooks or services.
- Avoid components larger than ~300 lines.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- No class components.

## State
- Keep state as close as possible to where it is used.
- Lift state only when necessary.
- Avoid unnecessary global state.
