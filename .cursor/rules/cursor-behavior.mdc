# Cursor Behavior Rules

Cursor should:
- Follow existing architecture and folder structure.
- Prefer simple and explicit solutions.
- Keep changes minimal and focused.
- Suggest refactoring when complexity increases.

Cursor must not:
- Introduce new libraries without reason.
- Add global state automatically.
- Change architectural style.
- Mix UI and business logic.
