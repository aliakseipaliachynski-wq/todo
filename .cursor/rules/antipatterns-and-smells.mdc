# Anti-patterns (Do Not Introduce)

- Business logic inside React components.
- Large “god files”.
- Global state for simple UI needs.
- Universal utils folders.
- Copy-pasted logic across features.
- Premature abstractions.

# Code Smells (Refactor When Seen)

- Functions with multiple responsibilities.
- Components that fetch, transform, and render data.
- Names like handleStuff, doThing, processData.
- Repeated conditional logic.
- Hooks with too many dependencies.
